# CS-300-DSA-Analysis-and-Design

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The problem I was solving in the projects was to analyze different data structures for reading data from a file, then taking that data and making course objects from each line in the file. Project One had me analyze the run-time and memory for the data structures, write pseudocode for the program, and then make a recommendation on which data structure I thought would be best to use when coding the program in Project Two.

# How did you approach the problem?
I approached the problem by doing as much research as I could on the best possible choice for the data structure for my problem. I went through the project guidelines over and over to ensure I understood what was expected of me. I then looked up the data structures to see which one would be the most efficient to use within the program. I studied each of the structures and how efficient they were with different operations. I then made my recommendation and coded the program based on my research.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When it came to the roadblocks I encountered, I did what I always do which is research the problem I am having to see if I could find a solution. If I could not find an answer on my own then I reached out for help from a tutor or my instructor.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
The work I completed in this course has changed my approach a little when it comes to designing software. It has made me more aware of the need for good solid planning and prep before coding. It has made me more mindful of the need to do your research beforehand to ensure you fully understand what you are designing and why.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The work on this project has not changed the way I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable but rather
